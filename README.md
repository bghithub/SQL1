# SQL1
SQL class project
Hello World
I am here to learn and be creating with the help of the community. I am a Nevada student in IS/ACC
Coding is a long lost learning process I have delayed for more than a decade
Now, with even more on my plate, I want to code really bad.
The first part is to pass the classes with excelence. Second part is to get certification. And Finally work in the blockchain industry to fix problems underlying the tech.
My next challenge is Database management mainly using SQL.  How do I start on it and get better at it?
